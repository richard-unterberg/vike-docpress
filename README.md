# telefunc

`telefunc` is a docs starter built as a real Vike application, not as a standalone docs theme.

The goal of this template is to give you a fully fledged SSR React app with a documentation runtime already integrated. You can ship docs, landing pages, custom product pages, and app-specific UI in the same codebase without fighting a docs-first framework that expects the whole project to behave like a docs site.

## Current Features

- SSR and prerendering through Vike
- MDX docs pages discovered from `pages/**/content.*.mdx`
- Global docs system config in `pages/+telefunc.ts`
- Per-document inherited config through `content.config.ts` / `content.config.js`
- Locale-aware routing with `en` and `zh`
- Light/dark theme support with pre-hydration theme bootstrapping
- Built-in localized search with build-time index generation and lazy client loading
- Landing page plus docs layout in one app
- Sidebar navigation, docs footer, and right-side table of contents

## What This Template Is

- A Vike + React SSR app with an MDX-powered docs runtime.
- A starter for teams that want docs inside a real application shell.
- A base for custom docs experiences, product sites, or hybrid marketing/docs apps.
- A repo with built-in theming, localization, sidebar navigation, and table of contents support.

## What This Template Is Not

- Not a generic static docs theme trying to replace Docusaurus, Starlight, or VitePress feature-for-feature.
- Not a batteries-included docs platform with versioning, search, analytics, and GitHub integrations already wired.
- Not a file-tree-driven docs generator where every docs folder is also a native Vike page subtree.

## Stack

- [Vike](https://vike.dev/) + [`vike-react`](https://vike.dev/react) for routing, SSR, prerendering, and app architecture
- [React 19](https://react.dev/)
  - can be replaced with SolidJS
- [Vite 7](https://vite.dev/)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) via `@mdx-js/rollup`
- [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [DaisyUI 5](https://daisyui.com/)
- [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/) for persisted user settings
- [`@classmatejs/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@classmatejs/react) for component class composition

## Docs Runtime Model

This repo keeps docs authoring content-only while still rendering docs as real Vike pages.

Instead:

- MDX files under `pages/(docs)/(content)/**` are the authoring source of truth.
- `lib/docs/vitePlugin.ts` generates routable Vike pages under `pages/(docs)/(generated)/**`.
- Shared per-document options live in `content.config.ts` / `content.config.js`.
- Global docs behavior lives in `pages/+telefunc.ts`.

This keeps SPA page-level routing/prefetch behavior without requiring maintainers to hand-author `+Page.tsx` / `+config.ts` files for each doc.

## Configuration

### Global docs settings

Use `pages/+telefunc.ts` for app-wide docs behavior:

```ts
import type { TelefuncSystemConfig } from '../lib/docs/systemConfig'

export default {
  defaultSlug: 'get-started',
  defaultDocConfig: {
    tableOfContents: true,
  },
  search: {
    indexedWordsPerDoc: 240,
  },
} satisfies TelefuncSystemConfig
```

Docs URLs are derived from the Vike route structure. In the current template, docs resolve at root-level paths such as `/get-started` instead of `/docs/get-started`.

`search.indexedWordsPerDoc` controls how many parsed words from each doc are included in the generated search index.

### Per-document shared settings

Use `content.config.ts` or `content.config.js` to define options shared by all translations of a doc route:

```ts
import type { DocConfig } from '@/lib/docs/config'

export default {
  tableOfContents: false,
} satisfies DocConfig
```

These config files inherit by logical doc path, so higher-level configs can apply defaults to nested docs.

## Search

Search indexes are generated from raw MDX content, not from rendered HTML.

- In dev, the Vite plugin serves locale-specific JSON at `/@search-index/<locale>.json`.
- In production builds, the same plugin emits `dist/client/assets/search-index.en.json` and `dist/client/assets/search-index.zh.json`.
- The plugin also patches `dist/assets.json` so deployments that rely on the asset manifest can discover those files.
- The navbar search loads the active locale index on demand and ranks matches on the client using title, slug, headings, and truncated body text.
